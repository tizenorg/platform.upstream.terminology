Compiling:
----------

Once you have met requirements, compiling and installing is simple:

  ./configure

Note: to make accented chars with deadkeys work, you need to use an
input method handler. Right now only XIM works, so try this before you

export ECORE_IMF_MODULE="xim"
export XMODIFIERS="@im=none"
